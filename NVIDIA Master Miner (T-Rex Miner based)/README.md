# NVIDIA Master Miner batch file (T-Rex Miner based)

Batch file to organize my different mining coins, algorithms & pools.

NOTE: This config file is the one I use, thus it has all of my personal addresses I use to obtain the different coins. Take this into consideration before using this config file, replacing ADDRESS fields and the API_KEY fields with your own personal information.
